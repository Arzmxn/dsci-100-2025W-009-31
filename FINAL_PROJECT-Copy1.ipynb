    "Game-related newsletters are used by developers and publishers to keep players informed about events and updates and increase player engagement. The UBC Computer Science research group is conducting a study on player behaviour in video games using a Minecraft research server. The team must target recruitment efforts, so understanding what factors may influence a player to subcribe can help them effectively recruit. \n",

    "We are given two datasets, but will only be using the `players.csv` dataset. Players differ in their demographics, such as experience, age, and gender, gaming experience , and engagement levels. These differences can influence their preferences for receiving newsletters. In this project, we will answer the broad question below, and specifically try to predict subscription status. \n",
