    "Game-related newsletters are used by developers and publishers to keep players informed about events and updates and increase player engagement. The UBC Computer Science research group is conducting a study on player behaviour in video games using a Minecraft research server. The team must target recruitment efforts, so understanding what factors may influence a player to subscribe can help them effectively recruit. \n",

    "We are given two datasets, but we will only be using the `players.csv` dataset. Players differ in their demographics, such as experience, age, and gender, gaming experience, and engagement levels. These differences can influence their preferences for receiving newsletters. In this project, we will answer the broad question below, and specifically try to predict subscription status. \n",

    "**Broad Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types? \n",
    "\n",

    "Can played hours and age predict subscription status in `players.csv`? \n",

    "**Expected Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to find that played hours and age will be able to predict the subscription status. We hypothesize that played hours will be a stronger predictor of newsletter subscription status, while age will have a weaker effect. Players who spend more time playing Minecraft are more likely to be more engaged and invested, and this higher engagement could influence their decision to subscribe to a newsletter. In contrast, age may influence the communication preferences slightly, but we do not expect that it will strongly determine subscription behaviour. We expect to see higher played hours correlate positively with subscription status. Overall, both variables will have an effect on the status, with played hours being a more significant predictor."

Each point represents a player, plotted by their age and total players. Most data points cluster near the bottom of the plot, which shows that the most of the players have relatively lower playtime (under 50 hours) regardless of their age. However, there are a few outliers in the plot, with some players with over 500 hours, all of whom are in the subscribed category. The age of the players ranges from early teens to mid-40s, but the subscription status does not show a clear trend across these ages and is distributed across all ages. One pattern that should be noted is that players with greater played hours are more likely to subscribe, as seen in the outliers of 50+ hours, while age seems to have a lower influence and is not a strong predictor of newsletter subscription.  This supports our hypothesis that engagement is a stronger predictor of newsletter subcription than age. \n",

    "**Fig. 2: Histogram of Age (yrs) with Subscription Status**\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2's histogram represents how the ages of players are distributed across subscribed and non-subscribed players, as seen in the distribution as \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\". The player's age in years is shown on the x-axis, while the y-axis shows the number of players within each eage bin. The bars are colour-coded for subscription status, with green indicating subscribed players (TRUE), and red indicating players that are not subscribed (FALSE). One finding from the plot reveals that the majority of players fall between ages 15 to 30, with a peak around age 20. Both subscribed and non-subscribed players are concentrated in this range with the proportions of both statuses appearing similar. As a result, we can conclude that age does not strongly differentiate subscription behaviour. Very few players are younger than 15 or older than 35, and we found that while players above 30 may seem less likely toy to subscribe, this observation is limited by the small number of players in that age group. When taking all of these interpretations together, this histogram leads us to understand that while most players are younger adults, the likelihood of subscribing to the newseltter is fairly evenly distributed  across the age range. This suggests that age cannot be used as a strong predictor for subscription status and aligns with our hypothesis that engagement will be a stronger predictor. \n",

    "**Fig. 3: Distribution of Playtime (hrs) with Subscription Status**\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 shows the distribution of play time in hours with the two subscription statuses, TRUE for subscribed, and FALSE for non-subscribed. The x-axis represents the total playtime while the y-axis depits the number of players. The bars are colour-coded by the players' subscription status. This histogram reveals that the majority of the players have playtimes of under 50, which had been noted in Figure 1 as most of the data is concentrated in the lower left. Within this low-playtime range, both subscribed and non-subscribed players are present in significant numbers, making it difficult to determine a clear pattern of dominance. Although we can see that there are slightly more subscribed players in this lower playtime range, the overlap that exists between the two groups suggests that we should not use playtime alone to separate subscription status in this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "As playtime increases beyond 50 hours, the number of players drops sharply, but the few players who remain are subscribed. At the extreme end of the distribution (players exceeding 200 hours), nearly all individuals are subscribed, but it is important to note that these points represent outliers. We can conclude that extremely high engagement correlates strongly with subscription, but for the majority of players with low playtime, the relationship is less clear as the visualization does not clearly display different hour rages. Therefore, while the overall trend supports the hypothesis that played hours influence subscription likelihood, it is important to understand that most players fall into the low-playtime category where subscription status is mixed, making it difficult to draw a definite conclusion.\n",

    "**Fig. 4: Line Plot of Accuracy Estimates vs. Neighours**\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization is a line plot that shows how the accuracy of a KNN classification model changes as the K (number of neighbours) changes. The x-axis demonstrates the number of neighbours (1-20), while the y-axis represents the accuracy estimate. When K = 1, there is a lower accuracy at 0.45, however, following this, the line plot rises sharply when K increases. At K = 10, the plot reaches 0.7 accuracy, and peaks at 0.75 when between K = 16 and K = 18. This shows that smaller K values will overfit the data, while moderate values of K represent more balanced values of accuracy and larger values underfit data. The overall interpretation that we found was that the best K for this question is K = 16 as it is the most accurate. It is important to note that the visualization also shows that the accuracy plateaus at 0.74 and does not go higher.\n",

    "**Summary of Findings and Comparision to Expected Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis combined one scatterplot, two histograms, and one line plot of a KNN model to better understand whether Age and Played Hours can predict newsletter subscription status. When looking at all of these together, our findings confirm our expected hypothesis: yes, these variables can predict the status, but only to a certain limited extent. Played hours are a more significant predictor for players that have higher hours, and therefore, engagement; age, on the other hand, adds little value, and for the majority of players with lower playtime, subscription status is mixed. We found that extreme engagement correlates strongly with newsletter interest, and interpret this as because players seek additional content and updates. However, we also found that this relationship is not exactly uniform, as Figure 3 shows that the majority of players fall into the low-playtime range (under 50 hours), where subscription status is mixed and difficult to distinguish visually. The KNN model’s moderate accuracy (~73.5%) confirms that while these variables provide some predictive power, they are not sufficient for strong classification on their own. "
